        <p>since i started blogging a little over 5 years ago i have used <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> to render
this blog. <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> is a static blog engine that allows one to write post in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>. Since i don&rsquo;t blog that much it was a small yak shave every time i did blog as <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> changed enough in the times between eáºƒhen i did blog as it was a slight hassle.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I was helping a colleague get a small interal blog set up but the amount of frustration we had getting it up and running was way more than was necessary. I remember reading somewhere about <a href="http://gohugo.io">hugo</a> a static site generator written in golang. We decided to give it a spin and was pleasantly suprised at how much easier it is to get started when your blogging platform has all it&rsquo;s dependencies baked into one executable. Well everything but the themes.</p>
<p>This recomendation was given before i had tried it myself so i decided to spend a couple of hours to migrate my blog under
easter weekend from <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> to <a href="http://gohugo.io">hugo</a>. It was pretty smooth i had everything migrated after
a couple of hours and an hour more to get the same design on the new and old blog.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long i will keep this or if in a couple of years another blog platform will convince me to migrate again
or if i decide to write my own. It really gets down to what i like more yak shaving or writting and some days there&rsquo;s
not much differnce.</p>
