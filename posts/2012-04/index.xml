      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since anything appeared but hopefully that has changed as I have moved the hosting of this blog to S3. My current hosting provider was a big hinder for me to update this blog using FTP. Have been wanting to move to S3 since august 2011 as that&amp;rsquo;s when S3 made it possible to host static sites easy.
Why didn&amp;rsquo;t I move to Wordpress or another blog system from jekyll?</description>
