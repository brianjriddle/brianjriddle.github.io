        <p>I have been using google reader since at least december 2008.  It was a great way
to stay on top of the current event&rsquo;s in my field as well as bloggers i find
interesting.  the biggest draw google reader had was that it was available on
every platform i used since it used a web based interface which meant i could
use it on computer at work, home and my mobile. after using it for a couple of
weeks i had abandoned liferea.</p>
<p>fast forward to december 2012.  i had started using mutt pretty exclusively for
my private email(would love to use it at work but they won&rsquo;t enable imap on exchange) and
read zed shaw <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/essays/i_want_the_mutt_of_feed_readers.html">I Want The Mutt Of Feed Readers</a>.
show i started testing newsbeuter at home and really liked the work flow i have with it but at the time
i could not come up with a way to make it work across different machines (home, work, phone) and have every thing
in sync.</p>
<p>then google announced the were sunsetting reader. i have to admit i started to panic as i use google reader
<em>a lot</em>. i looked at some of the services that competed with google reader <a href="www.feedly.com">feedly</a>, <a href="www.newsblur.com">newsblur</a> but
decided to take another look at newsbeuter.</p>
<p>so the past 2 weeks i have been testing newsbeuter out and can say that i enjoy this as much or better than
google reader.  to get around the synchronization problem i found that you can configure where newsbeuter keeps it&rsquo;s
cache.  it&rsquo;s an sqlite3 database and i put it in my Dropbox account. the only thing this doesn&rsquo;t fix
is that i can&rsquo;t access this on my phone but that is <em>ok</em> as i want to use my phone <em>less</em></p>
<p>my configuration is here</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/brianjriddle/dotfiles/blob/master/newsbeuter/config">newsbeuter/config</a></p>
<p>i have also added a small script to add an entry to my pinboard account</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/brianjriddle/dotfiles/blob/master/newsbeuter/bin/bookmark-pinboard.rb">newsbeuter/bin/bookmark-pinboard.rb</a></p>
<p>pretty happy with how this setup is working even if there are a couple of things that take a little more time - such as
viewing picture blogs like <a href="http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/">http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/</a>. it entails opening
up a browser to see the content but for <em>reading</em> and bookmarking it&rsquo;s a hella of a lot faster.</p>
