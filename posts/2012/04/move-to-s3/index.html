        <p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since anything appeared but hopefully that has changed
as I have moved the hosting of this blog to S3. My current hosting provider
was a big hinder for me to update this blog using FTP. Have been wanting
to move to S3 since august 2011 as that&rsquo;s when S3 made it possible to host
static sites easy.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t I move to Wordpress or another blog system from jekyll? Well
I do have some experience with Wordpress as we use it at work and have been
anything but impressed with it.</p>
<p>Using a static site generator such as jekyll has some benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>I understand pretty much all of the code jekyll is using.</li>
<li>only one tool. With a dynamic blog tool I&rsquo;ll have to learn another language(probably), have a database, think about backups, etc&hellip;</li>
<li>HTML is really hard to break. Given the 15+ years the Internet has lived with IE browsers will take pretty much any badly formatted HTML I throw at it.</li>
</ul>
