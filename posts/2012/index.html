    My adventures in the wonderful world of JAXB took an abrupt end a couple days after my last post. After the work I had put into trying to get a sensible way to generate the XSD&rsquo;s and java JAXB classes to parse a web service I had to go back to the drawing board as it did not survive the first contact with reality.
A couple of factors lead to giving up my first approach.

    The last day and half I have started a new project at work using java to parse a couple of different XML formats. I am building a small library to consume the XML output of a couple of web services. The formats themselves are nothing much to talk about but as this library needs to be in java and I can&rsquo;t use ruby and nokogiri  to parse the XML I was left with trying to do this using the tools java has available.

    It&rsquo;s been a long time since anything appeared but hopefully that has changed as I have moved the hosting of this blog to S3. My current hosting provider was a big hinder for me to update this blog using FTP. Have been wanting to move to S3 since august 2011 as that&rsquo;s when S3 made it possible to host static sites easy.
Why didn&rsquo;t I move to Wordpress or another blog system from jekyll?
