        <p>march 19-21 I and Anneli took our first trip by ourselves in a long time.
I really did not know what to expect as this is the first time traveling to central Europe and on top of that the first former communist country I have ever visited.</p>
<p>We got a really early start taking a taxi at 05:15 on Friday morning for our flight at 08:00 but that got us to Prague by 10:00 and our hotel by 11:30.  I really did not know what to expect as on the bus there were quite a few places that had razor wire. After getting to the hotel to drop our bags off we decided to have a quick bite before going on the 4 walking tour we booked. So we had Kozel beer, Anneli had goulash and I had the duck. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>After lunch it we checked into the hotel and got ready to go on a four hour walking tour. The hotel manage to get someone from the hotel to pick us up and take us to the meeting place in the old town.  There we got to see one of the main attractions to Prague the astronomical clock.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s like the worlds biggest cuckoo clock.</p>
<p>We walked quite a bit and saw lots of churches, the easter market, the palace <!-- raw HTML omitted -->,</p>
<p>The Charles bridge.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>After the walking tour we decided to sign up for the pub tour with our guide. Where we went to 3 different pubs and drank beer and ate.  The first day was kinda of tough but we got a fair idea of what we wanted to do on Saturday.</p>
