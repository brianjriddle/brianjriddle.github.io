        <p>Today we got an early start which was good as we were before the curve most of the day as a result. The Charles bridge was desolate at 08:00. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>One of the nicest things about Prague is all the different architecture you can see just walking around in the old town and its surrounding areas. Everything from Gothic</p>

<p>We were lucky to have a chance to see an exhibit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfons_Mucha">Alfons Muchas</a>.  I did not recognize his name at first but did easily recognize his but quick saw that I had seen quite a bit of his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Alphonse_Mucha">work before</a>.</p>
<p>After the exhibition we had lunch at the cubista a Czech cubist restaurant with decor from when cubism was born.</p>

<p>More wandering after lunch and a quick trip back to the hotel after finding a UK Tesco(My in Prague) and doing some quick shopping. Walking around somethings stand out especially on the edges of the old town where the influence of the communist rule is rears it&rsquo;s ugly head</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And the graffiti that abounds such as <a href="http://xkcd.com/26/">xkcd</a> copy</p>

<p>When in Prague it would a crime to not at least try to catch a classical music concert or go to a jazz club, which there are quite a few. We lucked out and found a string quintet from the Czech philharmonic at the music school.  We booked tickets and enjoyed a greatest hits of classical(Bach, Vivaldi, Mozart, Dvorak) music performed by and outstanding bunch of musicians.  Even I liked it and I am not the biggest fan.  Made Anneli promise that next time we would check out the jazz clubs.</p>
<p>We wandered around most of the rest of the day looking for a place to eat before the ghost walk we just <em>had</em> to go to. You know the ones we got <strong>free</strong>&hellip; I believe we ended up taking the first restaurant we could agree on once both our blood sugar had dropped enough and didn&rsquo;t want to walk any more. I don&rsquo;t know if it was the season (early spring) or if duck is a standard fare in the Czech republic but it was on most of the menus of the restaurants where we ate.</p>
<p>We were completely pooped after all the walking we had done during the day but we still managed the &ldquo;ghost walk&rdquo;.  We walked somewhere between 27-36,000 steps and there was still tons we did not even get to.</p>
