        <p>The day started with our first lesson in quantum mechanics. If you have read anything of what unclebob has written before
you know that he loves physics, space and starting with a tangential subject to start off any topic.</p>
<p>After that we went introduce ourself name, language(java/c#/c++), our experiences with TDD our companies.  From the introductions he mad a mind map and addressed the different subjects that came up such as &ldquo;only me&rdquo;, &ldquo;TDD Taliban&rdquo;, &ldquo;bad legacy code&rdquo;, &ldquo;no TDD allowed&rdquo;, etc.  he was frank to say that this course would not serve to allay our fears that we brought and that a part of our being a craftsman is that we should have options and we need to take stands on the issues(TDD as an example) that are important when we practice our profession.</p>
<p>After that it was a presentation of TDD theory until lunch. Each segue was a slight diversion about the form of an atom, speed of light, and the Casimir effect.</p>
<p>After lunch was a little more theory and diving into code.  The first code and activity we dove into was to get in our editors and run the tests and increase the coverage of the current test suite.  The second activity was to open up another project that had 100% code coverage and analyze that and suggest refactorings and how the code could be improved.</p>
<p>The last activity was a coding dojo where we were to create a word wrap program.  The flow was one person would create the test, the second would get it to work and the third person would refactor.  This took a lot longer than anybody expected as everybody was giving suggestions to the person driving the key board but it was a lot of fun.</p>
