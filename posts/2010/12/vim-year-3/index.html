        <p>This is the start of my third year with vim.  Before that I used emacs for about 7 years almost daily. A couple things made me switch</p>
<ul>
<li>I was using windows and I upgraded x-emacs one day and pretty much botch development environment</li>
<li>I realized that I was using vi/vim everyday because I was Permanently connected to some server via ssh and it was time to get more efficient.</li>
<li>I really needed to follow the use one editor and use it well from the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer">pragmatic programmer</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use vim almost exclusively today with one glaring exception.  <strong>java</strong>. For that I use Intellij as it has the best refactoring support of any of the java editors I have used. Don&rsquo;t know if I will ever rectify that but as I am writing less and less java these days it&rsquo;s not anything I think about much.</p>
<p>My use of vim really took off after reading Tim Ottinger&rsquo;s <a href="http://tottinge.blogsome.com/use-vim-like-a-pro">use vim like a pro</a>. If you are starting of with vim today I would still recommend using that but think that Yehuda katz blog post <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/">Everyone Who Tried to Convince Me to use Vim was Wrong</a> is probably a better place to start if you want a practical getting started <strong>now</strong>. Then there is <a href="http:://www.vimcasts.org">vimcasts</a> if you are wanting a good introduction in how to use vim.</p>
