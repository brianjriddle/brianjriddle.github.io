        <p>Today I did the stupidest thing I probably have ever done so far in my life.  I would not say I competed as it took over <a href="http://www.resultat.vasaloppet.se/vasa/result?oid=1010568">11 hours</a> and the fastest time that day was somewhere around 5. I would have never had a chance to finish at all if it had not been for the support of family and friends before and during the race.  Help was needed as I had never even stood on cross country skis before January 19, 2010 little more than 6 weeks before the 90k race.</p>
<p>And it has been fun. All of it. Jumping feet first into something new, the long weekend in <a href="http://www.harsa.se/">Harsa</a> for a ski camp with new and old friends, meeting or at least passing by the <a href="http://www.royalcourt.se/kungafamiljen.4.1c3432a100d8991c5b80002606.html">king and queen of sweden</a> and seeing tons of sweden that I would not have seen otherwise.</p>
<p>Other than the support from my loved ones the only things that made it possible was I had to keep a positive mental attitude and better living through chemicals :).  90k could <strong>not</strong> be long, the race could not be <strong>that</strong> hard.  Up until the day of the race that worked quite well and worked for most of the race. My mind wandered on other things to keep from thinking about the physical pain that I was enduring the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bene_Gesserit#Litany_against_fear">&lsquo;litany against fear&rsquo;</a>. As far as the chemicals they were a necessary evil. It mainly entailed drinking a high carbohydrate mix (that looked like shredded fiber glass), ibuprofen, energy bars and protein drinks. Thankfully it was only for a short time a couple of days before the race that I had to start loading up on carbos.</p>
