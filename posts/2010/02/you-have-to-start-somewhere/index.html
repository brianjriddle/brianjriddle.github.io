        <p>Just finished reading stephen covey&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/0684858398/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1266607077&amp;sr=8-1">7 habits of highly effective people</a>. I was not prepared for what I had bought.  I thought that I bought a book that was going to give me practical tools to be more productive.</p>
<p>Luckily I could not have been more wrong.  This book was more about basic internal characteristics that highly effective people have.  It was the first self help book I had ever read.  I agree the values/principals laid out as I see them at least in others.  It&rsquo;s written with <strong>tons</strong> of both person and 2rd party stories interwoven with the theories presented.</p>
<p>Reading it after having lived in Europe for 10+ years coupled with some pretty strong agnostic tendencies made me almost put it down and not return but
i plowed on.</p>
<p>Next book is Gregory T. Brown&rsquo;s &lsquo;ruby best practices&rsquo;.</p>
