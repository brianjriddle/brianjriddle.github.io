      <description>Just finished reading stephen covey&amp;rsquo;s 7 habits of highly effective people. I was not prepared for what I had bought. I thought that I bought a book that was going to give me practical tools to be more productive.
Luckily I could not have been more wrong. This book was more about basic internal characteristics that highly effective people have. It was the first self help book I had ever read.</description>
