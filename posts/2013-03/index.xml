      <description>I have been using google reader since at least december 2008. It was a great way to stay on top of the current event&amp;rsquo;s in my field as well as bloggers i find interesting. the biggest draw google reader had was that it was available on every platform i used since it used a web based interface which meant i could use it on computer at work, home and my mobile.</description>
