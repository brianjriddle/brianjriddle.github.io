      <description>since i started blogging a little over 5 years ago i have used jekyll to render this blog. jekyll is a static blog engine that allows one to write post in markdown. Since i don&amp;rsquo;t blog that much it was a small yak shave every time i did blog as jekyll changed enough in the times between eáºƒhen i did blog as it was a slight hassle.
A couple of weeks ago I was helping a colleague get a small interal blog set up but the amount of frustration we had getting it up and running was way more than was necessary.</description>
