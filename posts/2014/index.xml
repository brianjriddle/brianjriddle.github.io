      <description>I changed jobs recently and had to come to grips with not having a smart phone for the first time in 5+ years.
I changed in the middle of summer just after Google I/O and before the iphone 6/6+ came out. I decided to wait and see which one I would get. In the mean time I decided to buy the simplest phone i could. The only requirement was that it was charged via micro usb.</description>
