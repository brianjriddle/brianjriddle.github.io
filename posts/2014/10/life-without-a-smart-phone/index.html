        <p>I changed jobs recently and had to come to grips with not having a smart
phone for the first time in 5+ years.</p>
<p>I changed in the middle of summer just after Google I/O and before the
iphone 6/6+ came out.  I decided to wait and see which one I would
get. In the mean time I decided to buy the simplest phone i could.  The
only requirement was that it was charged via micro usb.</p>
<p>The only candidate i could find was a samsung flip phone. it was by far better
than the first mobile phone i had but not by much.  I can call and send text messages
and that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been an interesting couple of months and i don&rsquo;t know how long this little experiment it
going to continue.  Some of the things i have obesrved:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I notice how much everybody else is on their phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not being able to get to mail has been good - at least until the kids school started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My kids don&rsquo;t know how to use t-9. which has been hilarious at times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>need to keep a map in the car</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can&rsquo;t get to my passwords at all when i am not near a computer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only have to charge it every other week and it charges in max 45 minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can&rsquo;t take pictures - don&rsquo;t carry a camera.  Have missed out on some of those little life moments not being able to take a picture/video</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i need to use a computer more often - to check mail and what not. i also get on the computer and off a lot more quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I carry my kindle around more often than not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long this is going to last but probably not much longer it has helped that i have starting riding my bike
to and from work most days.</p>
